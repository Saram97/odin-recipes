      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I admit it, I still love ramen. In this yummy recipe, expect fast, easy, and spicy with salty, sweet, 
            and sour flavors kicking in. 
          <br>The spiciness level can be adapted to your taste by adjusting the chili garlic sauce.</p> 
        <p>This will make 4 side servings or 3 hearty main course servings.</p>
        

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
              <li>1Â½ tablespoons brown sugar</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
              <li>2 teaspoons chili-garlic sauce, or more to taste</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
              <li>3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Noodles</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles</li>
              <li>2 tablespoons chopped peanuts</li>
              <li>2 medium green onions, thinly sliced diagonally</li>
          </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Whisk soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar, chili garlic sauce, and ginger together in a small bowl. 
            <br>Add peanut butter, whisking until well combined, and set aside.</li>
          <li>Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a pot. Discard the flavor packet and add ramen noodles to the boiling water. 
              Cook until noodles are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. 
            <br>Drain noodles, reserving some of the noodle water in case you need to thin out the sauce later.</li>
          <li>Pour sauce over ramen noodles, tossing until well coated. 
              If sauce is too thick, thin out with a small amount of the reserved noodle water until you reach your desired consistency. 
            <br>Your hot noodles will soak up the sauce. Garnish with peanuts and green onion, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
